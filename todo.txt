this is an ai-agent that auto deploys contract on solana 

at client if response from llm starts with phase 3: there should be a contract in the same response like so that starts with rust and ends with end contract 
what you need to do is send this contract to backend to deploy it on backend and when deployment is done send the contract address back to client 



here is the example of response from llm:
Phase 3: Here is the Solana smart contract code for a simple deposit function using SOL:

rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

#[program]
pub mod simple_deposit {
    use super::*;

    pub fn deposit(ctx: Context<Deposit>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
        let depositor = &mut ctx.accounts.depositor;
        let vault = &mut ctx.accounts.vault;

        depositor.transfer(vault.to_account_info(), amount)?;

        Ok(())
}
}

#[account]
pub struct Depositor {
    pub bump: u8,
}

#[account]
pub struct Vault {
    pub balance: u64,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Deposit<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub depositor: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(init, payer = depositor, space = 8 + 8, seeds = [b"vault"], bump)]
    pub vault: Account<'info, Vault>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}


end contract

Would you like to deploy this code?
